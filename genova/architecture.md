Genoa’s architecture is distinctive and reflects its long, complex history as a powerful maritime republic, a crossroads of Mediterranean cultures, and a city built on steep hills between mountains and sea. Here are the most **typical and unique features** of Genoa’s architecture:

---

## **1. Palazzi dei Rolli and Strade Nuove**
- **UNESCO World Heritage:** The *Palazzi dei Rolli* are a group of Renaissance and Baroque palaces built by Genoa’s aristocratic families, mainly along the *Strade Nuove* (“New Streets”) such as Via Garibaldi, Via Balbi, and Via Cairoli.
- **Distinctive Features:** Grand facades, elaborate courtyards, monumental staircases, frescoed ceilings, and lush gardens. These palaces were part of a public lodging system for visiting dignitaries.
- **Example:** [Palazzo Rosso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Rosso), [Palazzo Bianco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Bianco), [Palazzo Doria Tursi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Doria_Tursi).

## **2. Medieval Old Town (Centro Storico)**
- **Caruggi:** The historic center is a maze of narrow, winding alleys called *caruggi*, with tall, closely packed buildings. This layout is a legacy of the medieval period and is one of the largest preserved old towns in Europe.
- **Tower Houses:** Many medieval houses were built as tall, narrow towers for defense and status.
- **Contrasts:** The old town’s dense, vertical architecture contrasts with the grand, open spaces of the Renaissance palaces.

---

## **3. Black-and-White Striped Churches**
- **Distinctive Style:** Many Genoese churches, such as the **Cathedral of San Lorenzo**, feature striking black-and-white striped marble facades, a style influenced by both Ligurian and Pisan traditions.
- **Romanesque and Gothic:** The city’s churches often blend Romanesque and Gothic elements, with ornate portals, rose windows, and sculpted capitals.

---

## **4. Fortifications and Walls**
- **City Walls:** Genoa was heavily fortified, with several rings of city walls and numerous forts on the surrounding hills (e.g., Forte Sperone, Forte Diamante).
- **Port Structures:** The old port area features historic warehouses, arcades, and the iconic **Lanterna** lighthouse, a symbol of the city.

---

## **5. Colorful Facades and Frescoes**
- **Painted Palaces:** Many buildings, especially in the historic center, have brightly colored facades and are decorated with trompe-l’oeil frescoes, imitating architectural details or classical scenes.
- **Pastel Colors:** The use of ochre, pink, yellow, and green is typical, reflecting Ligurian tastes and the Mediterranean climate.

---

## **6. Adaptation to Terrain**
- **Vertical City:** Genoa’s steep hills have led to a “vertical” cityscape, with terraced buildings, stairways, funiculars, and elevators connecting different levels.
- **Panoramic Views:** Many buildings and public spaces offer dramatic views over the city and the sea.

---

## **7. Modern and Contemporary Architecture**
- **Renzo Piano:** The famous Genoese architect redesigned parts of the old port (Porto Antico), including the Aquarium of Genoa and the Bigo panoramic lift.
- **Liberty Style:** Early 20th-century Art Nouveau (Liberty) buildings can be found in some neighborhoods.
